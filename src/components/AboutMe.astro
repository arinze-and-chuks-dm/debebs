    Hi! My name is Edwina. I am the Chief Photographer and Creative Director at ITSaSHADE. William Shakespeare said, "Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder." Still, for me, beauty is in the eye of my camera lens.
    For the past five years, I have explored the different depths of photography, videography, and graphic design. No project is too challenging. So, what are your ideas? What is your vision? Let's talk about it and make your thoughts a reality.
