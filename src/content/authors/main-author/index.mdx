Howdy, I'm glad you're here! I'm **Edwina Debebs**; you can call me **Eddie**!

## My Story

{/* //TODO: Update to make personal and longer */}

I am the Chief Photographer and Creative Director at Debebs Media.

William Shakespeare said, “Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.” Still, for me, beauty is in the eye of my camera lens.

For the past five years, I have explored the different depths of photography, videography, and graphic design. No project is too challenging. So, what are your ideas? What is your vision?
Let’s talk about it and make your thoughts a reality.

{/* From my family to yours, I am excited to capture your memories and create a masterpiece that will last a lifetime. */}
